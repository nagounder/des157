      <p>The topic I wanted to focus on was the issue of food waste or increasing the accessibility to food for people who are not able to do so. While this issue may not traditionally fall under the topic of diversity, I believe that it contributes to the
        lack of diversity in who has access to food – a basic human need. Even though there is enough food produced in the world to end hunger, nearly 1/3 of this food is wasted with hunger prevalent even in first world countries. Therefore, my current
        idea is to build an app/system that would enable people to take food that would be wasted to people who need that food. There are a number of apps that try to cater to the problem of food waste or increasing access to food, but most are not widely
        used. The problem is that people/businesses who possess the food that would be wasted need an incentive to donate this food, they are often not willing to put in work that does not directly benefit them.</p>

      <p>After performing extensive research on this topic and potential demographics, I thought the most functional short term solution would use the Davis college community as the primary demographic. This particular demographic already has numerous community
        groups that involve buying and selling, and exchanging goods and services (ex. UC Davis Rideshare FB Group). This would eliminate the problem of being uncomfortable of accepting food from unknown persons. </p>

      <p>The goals of this project involves creating a sustainable system of distributing leftover food from events, club meetings, etc. to prevent it from going to waste and deriving the maximum use out of this resource. It’s secondary goal is to introduce
        students to each other as well as campus organizations and events.</p>

      <p>The primary and most effective communication strategy would probably include creating either an app or a mobile friendly website. Most students use their mobile phone to quickly check updates on their surrounding physical and social environment
        and therefore a responsive website might be more accessible and maintainable in terms of infrastructure. Implementing a UC Davis login page such as that in canvas would also be a good way of monitoring traffic to the website. </p>

      <p>For the overall user interface, I am planning on creating a mobile friendly, responsive website that is simple and easy to use. The site flow would probably start with the UC Davis Kerberos login and then navigating to the main page where a student
        can upload a picture and description of the leftover food and tag the location on a map. Students would be able to maintain their own posts depending on the availability and clubs and campus organizations can take advantage of this website to
        advertise and generate traffic to their events. This would be a good method of quality control and students would feel comfortable taking food. Secondary services on the website would include showing students other places where food is available
        (Ex. Fruit and Veggie Up! at the MU). </p>
